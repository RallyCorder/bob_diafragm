			<p>The Manifesto, Industrial Society and its Future, has been criticized as ”unoriginal,”
				but this misses the point. The Manifesto was never intended to be original. Its purpose
				was to set forth certain points about modern technology in clear and relatively brief
				form, so that those points could be read and understood by people who would never
				work their way through a difficult text such as Jacques Ellul’s Technological Society.
